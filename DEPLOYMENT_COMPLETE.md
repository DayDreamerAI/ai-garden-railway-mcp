# Railway Deployment - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Sync Complete, ⏳ Railway Redeploy Pending

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

### 1. Architecture & Best Practices ✅
- **Documentation:** `CONNECTOR_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` created
- **Pattern:** Private dev (daydreamer-mcp) → Public deploy (ai-garden-railway-mcp)
- **Separation:** Servers (universal) → Connectors (platform adapters) → Deployment (minimal public)

### 2. Repository Cleanup ✅
- **Before:** 60+ files (deprecated from old repo migration)
- **After:** 16 active files + organized archive/
- **Archived:** 15 old servers, 17 old scripts, 9 old docs
- **Structure:** Clean, production-ready deployment directory

### 3. Deployment Implementation ✅
- **Tier 1 Server:** `mcp-claude-connector-memory-server.py` (530 lines, 5 tools)
- **Test Suite:** `test_railway_memory_server.py` (390 lines, 7 tests)
- **Sync Script:** `deploy_to_railway.sh` (automated private→public sync)
- **Configuration:** `railway.toml` updated for Tier 1

### 4. Deployment Execution ✅
- **Public Repo Synced:** https://github.com/DayDreamerAI/ai-garden-railway-mcp
- **Commit:** ad4396a "deploy: Tier 1 memory server v2025.10.05-1356"
- **Files Deployed:**
  - mcp-claude-connector-memory-server.py (Tier 1 server)
  - railway.toml (Railway config)
  - requirements.txt (Python deps)
  - README.md (deployment docs)
  - .env.template (env vars)

## ⏳ Railway Redeploy Status

### Current State
- ✅ Files synced to public repo
- ✅ Commit pushed to main branch
- ✅ railway.toml updated with correct startCommand
- ⏳ **Railway auto-redeploy pending** (webhook delay or requires manual trigger)

### What Railway Is Currently Serving
- **Old Server:** minimal_sse_server.py (1 tool: raw_cypher_query)
- **Health Status:** HTTP 200 ✅
- **Should Be:** mcp-claude-connector-memory-server.py (5 Tier 1 tools)

### Verification
```bash
# Current deployment (OLD)
curl https://ai-garden-railway-mcp-production.up.railway.app/health
# Returns: version "1.0.0", server name "daydreamer-memory-test"

# Test suite shows only 1 tool
RAILWAY_SERVER_URL="..." python3 test_railway_memory_server.py
# Result: ✅ 2/7 tests (initialize, tools/list)
# Reason: Old server still deployed
```

---

## 🔧 Next Step: Manual Railway Redeploy

### Option A: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Navigate to: `ai-garden-railway-mcp-production` project
3. Click: **"Deploy" → "Redeploy Latest"**
4. Wait: ~2 minutes for build + deployment
5. Test: Run validation suite

### Option B: CLI Redeploy
```bash
# If Railway CLI credentials working
cd /tmp/ai-garden-railway-mcp
railway redeploy

# Or force new deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Railway redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Option C: Webhook Trigger
```bash
# If Railway has deployment webhook
curl -X POST <railway-webhook-url>
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results After Redeploy

### Test Suite Validation
```bash
RAILWAY_SERVER_URL="https://ai-garden-railway-mcp-production.up.railway.app" \
TEST_MODE=railway \
python3 test_railway_memory_server.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Test 1: Initialize MCP Connection
✅ Test 2: List Available Tools (5 tools)
✅ Test 3: Search Nodes
✅ Test 4: Memory Statistics
✅ Test 5: Create Test Entity
✅ Test 6: Add Observations
✅ Test 7: Raw Cypher Query

Total Tests: 7
✅ Passed: 7
❌ Failed: 0
```

### Tier 1 Tools Available
1. **search_nodes** - Semantic search or exact lookup
2. **memory_stats** - Graph statistics with V6 status
3. **create_entities** - Entity creation with embeddings
4. **add_observations** - Observation management
5. **raw_cypher_query** - Direct Cypher access

## 🚀 Future Workflow

### Regular Development Cycle

1. **Develop** (Private Repo)
   ```bash
   cd /llm/mcp/connectors/mcp-claude-connector/neo4j-mcp-railway-repo/
   # Edit mcp-claude-connector-memory-server.py
   # Test locally
   ```

2. **Deploy** (One Command)
   ```bash
   ./deploy_to_railway.sh
   # Syncs to public repo, triggers Railway
   ```

3. **Validate** (Automated Testing)
   ```bash
   RAILWAY_SERVER_URL="..." python3 test_railway_memory_server.py
   ```

4. **Monitor** (Production Metrics)
   ```bash
   curl https://ai-garden-railway-mcp-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
