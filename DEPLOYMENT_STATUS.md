# Railway Deployment Status Report

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Session:** Autonomous Deployment Implementation

---

## üéØ Objective

Create autonomous Railway deployment workflow enabling Claude Code to deploy MCP servers without user input.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Architecture & Planning
- ‚úÖ ULTRATHINK analysis complete (15 thoughts)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive deployment plan: `plans/railway-autonomous-deployment-plan.md`
- ‚úÖ Analyzed Railway CLI v4.10.0 capabilities
- ‚úÖ Researched Railway GraphQL API v2

### 2. Implementation
- ‚úÖ **Tier 1 Memory Server Created** (530 lines)
  - File: `mcp-claude-connector-memory-server.py`
  - Tools: 5 core operations (search_nodes, memory_stats, create_entities, add_observations, raw_cypher_query)
  - Architecture: SSE dual-endpoint, JinaV3 embeddings, AuraDB integration
  - Tool registry system for dynamic management

- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Test Suite** (390 lines)
  - File: `test_railway_memory_server.py`
  - Coverage: 7 tests for Tier 1 validation
  - Supports local and Railway testing modes

- ‚úÖ **Autonomous Deployment Script** (159 lines)
  - File: `deploy_autonomous.sh`
  - Railway GraphQL API integration
  - Automatic project detection/creation
  - Health check validation

### 3. Configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `railway.toml` for Tier 1 server
  - Changed startCommand to: `python -u mcp-claude-connector-memory-server.py`
  - Maintained health check and timeout settings

- ‚úÖ Git workflow setup
  - Created feature branch: `feat/tier1-memory-server-deployment`
  - Committed Tier 1 implementation (commit: e926be8)
  - Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/DayDreamerAI/ai-garden-railway-mcp

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Blockers

### 1. Railway CLI Authentication Issue
**Problem:** Railway CLI doesn't accept API token for authentication

**Attempts Made:**
```bash
# Tried environment variables
RAILWAY_API_TOKEN="4dca6770..." railway whoami
# Result: Unauthorized

# Tried config file update
~/.railway/config.json with API token
# Result: Unauthorized

# Tried browserless login
railway login --browserless
# Result: "Cannot login in non-interactive mode"
```

**Root Cause:** Railway CLI v4.10.0 requires session token (Iron format: `rw_Fe26.2**...`) for authentication, not API token. API token only works via GraphQL API.

### 2. Project Linking Challenge
**Problem:** Cannot link local directory to existing Railway project

**Issue:** GraphQL API queries for projects/workspaces return authorization errors:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" ...workspaces query...
# Result: "Problem processing request"
```

**Root Cause:** API token likely has limited scope and can't access team/workspace projects. The existing deployment (`ai-garden-railway-mcp-production`) might be under a team account.

### 3. Deployment Trigger
**Problem:** Current deployment not updated with Tier 1 server

**Current State:**
- Production URL: https://ai-garden-railway-mcp-production.up.railway.app
- Deployed Server: minimal_sse_server.py (1 tool: raw_cypher_query)
- Test Results: 2/7 tests passing (initialize, tools/list only)

**Issue:** Railway not automatically deploying from feature branch push. Likely watches main branch only.

## üîç Test Results Summary

### Production Deployment Test (Oct 5, 2025 13:35)

**Server:** https://ai-garden-railway-mcp-production.up.railway.app

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Initialize MCP | ‚úÖ PASS | Server: daydreamer-memory-test v1.0.0 |
| List Tools | ‚úÖ PASS | Found 1 tool: raw_cypher_query |
| Search Nodes | ‚ùå FAIL | Unknown tool: search_nodes |
| Memory Stats | ‚ùå FAIL | Unknown tool: memory_stats |
| Create Entities | ‚ùå FAIL | Unknown tool: create_entities |
| Add Observations | ‚ùå FAIL | Unknown tool: add_observations |
| Raw Cypher Query | ‚ùå FAIL | JSON parse error |

**Conclusion:** Deployment still running minimal server, not Tier 1 server.

## üìã Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Option A: Merge to Main (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Railway likely auto-deploys from main branch
- Standard git workflow
- Enables PR review process

**Steps:**
1. Create PR from `feat/tier1-memory-server-deployment` ‚Üí `main`
2. Review and merge PR
3. Railway auto-deploys from main
4. Run test suite validation

**Command:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: Tier 1 Railway MCP memory server with 5 core tools" \
  --body "Implements Tier 1 deployment with search_nodes, memory_stats, create_entities, add_observations, raw_cypher_query"
```

### Option B: Railway Web Console Manual Deploy
**Pros:**
- Immediate deployment
- No authentication issues
- Visual confirmation

**Steps:**
1. Login to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Navigate to ai-garden-railway-mcp-production project
3. Trigger manual deployment from GitHub repo
4. Select `feat/tier1-memory-server-deployment` branch

### Option C: Session Token Extraction
**Pros:**
- Enables CLI automation
- Reusable for future deployments

**Steps:**
1. Login via Railway web (browser)
2. Extract session token from browser DevTools (Application ‚Üí Cookies)
3. Update ~/.railway/config.json with session token
4. Test: `railway whoami`
5. If successful: `railway up` from project directory

### Option D: Railway GitHub App Integration
**Pros:**
- Automated deployments on every push
- Branch-specific environments

**Steps:**
1. Connect Railway to GitHub repo via Railway dashboard
2. Configure deployment triggers (main branch)
3. Push changes trigger automatic deployments

### SSE Architecture
- GET /sse ‚Üí Connection establishment, endpoint event
- POST /messages?session_id={id} ‚Üí JSON-RPC handling
- Tool registry system for dynamic management
- JinaV3 embeddings with LRU cache (1000 entries)

### AuraDB Integration
- URI: neo4j+s://8c3b5488.databases.neo4j.io

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Railway CLI API Token Limitation**: API tokens don't work with CLI (only GraphQL API). Need session tokens for CLI operations.

2. **Project Scope**: API tokens may have limited scope. Team/workspace projects might not be accessible via personal API token.

3. **Git Integration**: Railway likely auto-deploys from specific branches (main). Feature branches may not trigger deployments.

4. **GraphQL Schema**: Railway GraphQL v2 API schema requires specific query formats. Some queries result in "Problem processing request" errors.
