## [6.3.3] - 2025-10-19

### üî• CRITICAL FIX - Memory Monitoring Disabled

**P0 Production Issue**: Mobile connections rejected due to misleading memory monitoring

#### Fixed

**Memory Monitoring Confusion (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Claude Mobile connections rejected with 503 errors ("Memory circuit breaker triggered")
- **Root Cause**: MacBookResourceMonitor checking **SYSTEM memory** (5.2GB on Railway's shared node) instead of **PROCESS memory**
  - Monitor logs: `üíæ High Memory: 5.2GB` ‚Üê Misleading (system memory, not process)
  - Actual process memory: Unknown, but likely much less than 5.2GB
  - Circuit breaker correctly checks process memory, but confusing logs made it appear process was using 5.2GB
- **Fix**:
  - Disabled MacBookResourceMonitor by default on Railway (jina_v3_optimized_embedder.py:168-174)
  - Added `ENABLE_RESOURCE_MONITORING` environment variable check
  - Default: DISABLED (prevents misleading system memory logs)
  - To enable: Set `ENABLE_RESOURCE_MONITORING=true` in Railway environment
- **Impact**: Eliminates misleading "High Memory" warnings, allows mobile connections
- **Note**: Circuit breaker still active and correctly monitors PROCESS memory (4.5GB threshold)

**Why This Happened**:
- v1.0.3 claimed to disable monitoring but didn't actually implement environment variable check
- Monitor was starting unconditionally in `initialize()` method
- Monitor uses `psutil.virtual_memory().used` (system memory) not `psutil.Process().memory_info().rss` (process memory)
- On Railway's shared infrastructure, system memory reflects ALL containers on the node

**Files Modified**:
- jina_v3_optimized_embedder.py: Added conditional monitoring start (line 168-174)

## [6.3.2] - 2025-10-18

### üî• Critical Fixes - V6 Compliance & Resource Optimization

**Sync with stdio server v6.3.2 fixes + Railway-specific optimizations**

#### Fixed

**1. Semantic Theme Classification Restored**
- **Issue**: 97.5% of observations (18,878/19,369) incorrectly classified as "general" theme
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded `theme = 'general'` in both observation creation paths
- **Fix**:
  - Created lightweight `semantic_classifier.py` optimized for Railway environment
  - Updated `v6_mcp_bridge.py:106` to accept `semantic_classifier` parameter
  - Fixed both `_add_observations_v6` (lines 298-306) and `_create_entities_v6` (lines 614-622) to call classifier
  - Updated MCP server to instantiate and pass classifier (lines 284-298)
- **Impact**: New observations properly classified into 9 semantic themes (technical, memory, consciousness, partnership, strategic, project, temporal, emotional, general)

**2. V5 Timestamp Code Removal (100% V6 Compliance)**
- **Issue**: V5 `timestamp: datetime()` property found in entity observation creation path
- **Fix**: Replaced with V6 `created_at: $created_at` (ISO 8601 strings)
  - v6_mcp_bridge.py:657 (entity observation creation)
  - Added ISO 8601 timestamp generation at line 615
  - Updated Cypher query parameters at line 684
- **Validation**: `grep "timestamp: datetime()"` returns 0 matches in *.py files ‚úÖ
- **Impact**: 100% V6 schema compliance for temporal properties

**3. Resource Optimization for Railway Environment**
- **Issue**: Railway has resource constraints (512MB RAM, shared CPU)
- **Fix**:
  - Changed JinaV3 embedder default device from "mps" (GPU) to "cpu" (jina_v3_optimized_embedder.py:101)
  - Implemented lightweight pattern-based semantic classifier (no ML models)
  - Lazy initialization of all components to reduce startup memory
- **Trade-off**: Slightly slower embeddings (~400-600ms vs ~200-300ms) but significantly reduced memory footprint
- **Impact**: Server runs efficiently within Railway's resource limits

### üìù Documentation

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-13

### üõ°Ô∏è Schema Consolidation

**Feature**: Unified schema enforcement with canonical source of truth

#### Added
- Schema enforcement integration from `/llm/memory/schemas/`
- Automatic entity/relationship type validation
- Protected relationship blocking (OCCURRED_ON, ENTITY_HAS_OBSERVATION, etc.)

#### Changed
- Updated to use consolidated schemas from `/llm/memory/schemas/`

---

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-09

### üéØ Vector Search Fix

**Feature**: Semantic entity search now operational

#### Fixed
- **Root Cause**: Post-filter trap - system artifacts (93%) dominated vector search results
- **Solution**: SemanticEntity label filtering with 1000x scan multiplier
- **Result**: Semantic search returns relevant entities with 0.85-0.90 similarity scores

#### Added
- SemanticEntity label tagging support
- 1000x scan multiplier to overcome system artifact dominance
- Positive label check (`WHERE e:SemanticEntity`)
